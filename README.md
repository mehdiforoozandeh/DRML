Drug Resistance Prediction in Escherichia coli Bacteria Using Machine Learning

Drug resistance (DR) is the ability of a pathogenic bacteria to resist treatment by an antibiotic and it became a public health threat not long after the introduction of penicillin, the first modern antibiotic which was discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming in the early 1940s. 

In order to counter this threat, new approaches are in demand to understand the major factors causing antibiotic-resistance and to predict DR from genomic data. These genomics-based approaches hold the promise of being more accurate and more efficient than their current clinical alternatives.

This project aims at developing a machine learning-based tool that will be able to learn the complex relationships that exist between a set of predictor variables (in our case, genomic variants of bacteria) and an outcome of interest (in our case, resistance to antibiotics).
